	Abstract = {Conformal prediction is a learning framework that produces models that associate with each of their predictions a measure of statistically valid confidence.
 These models are typically constructed on top of traditional machine learning algorithms.
 An important result of conformal prediction theory is that the models produced are provably valid under relatively weak assumptions---in particular,
 their validity is independent of the specific underlying learning algorithm on which they are based.
 Since validity is automatic, much research on conformal predictors has been focused on improving their informational and computational efficiency.
 As part of the efforts in constructing efficient conformal predictors, aggregated conformal predictors were developed,
 drawing inspiration from the field of classification and regression ensembles.
 Unlike early definitions of conformal prediction procedures, the validity of aggregated conformal predictors is not fully understood---while it has been shown
 that they might attain empirical exact validity under certain circumstances,
 their theoretical validity is conditional on additional assumptions that require further clarification.
 In this paper, we show why validity is not automatic for aggregated conformal predictors,
 and provide a revised definition of aggregated conformal predictors that gains approximate validity
 conditional on properties of the underlying learning algorithm.},

	Abstract = {We present the aggregated conformal predictor (ACP), an extension to the traditional inductive conformal prediction (ICP) where several inductive conformal predictors are applied on the same training set and their individual predictions are aggregated to form a single prediction on an example. The results from applying ACP on two pharmaceutical data sets (CDK5 and GNRHR) indicate that the ACP has advantages over traditional ICP. ACP reduces the variance of the prediction region estimates and improves efficiency. Still, it is more conservative in terms of validity than ICP, indicating that there is room for further improvement of efficiency without compromising validity.},

	Abstract = {A wealth of biospecimen samples are stored in modern globally distributed biobanks. Biomedical researchers worldwide need to be able to combine the available resources to improve the power of large-scale studies. A prerequisite for this effort is to be able to search and access phenotypic, clinical and other information about samples that are currently stored at biobanks in an integrated manner. However, privacy issues together with heterogeneous information systems and the lack of agreed-upon vocabularies have made specimen searching across multiple biobanks extremely challenging. We describe three case studies where we have linked samples and sample descriptions in order to facilitate global searching of available samples for research. The use cases include the ENGAGE (European Network for Genetic and Genomic Epidemiology) consortium comprising at least 39 cohorts, the SUMMIT (surrogate markers for micro- and macro-vascular hard endpoints for innovative diabetes tools) consortium and a pilot for data integration between a Swedish clinical health registry and a biobank. We used the Sample avAILability (SAIL) method for data linking: first, created harmonised variables and then annotated and made searchable information on the number of specimens available in individual biobanks for various phenotypic categories. By operating on this categorised availability data we sidestep many obstacles related to privacy that arise when handling real values and show that harmonised and annotated records about data availability across disparate biomedical archives provide a key methodological advance in pre-analysis exchange of information between biobanks, that is, during the project planning phase.},

@article{Gaye:2014sf,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research in modern biomedicine and social science requires sample sizes so large that they can often only be achieved through a pooled co-analysis of data from several studies. But the pooling of information from individuals in a central database that may be queried by researchers raises important ethico-legal questions and can be controversial. In the UK this has been highlighted by recent debate and controversy relating to the UK's proposed 'care.data' initiative, and these issues reflect important societal and professional concerns about privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property. DataSHIELD provides a novel technological solution that can circumvent some of the most basic challenges in facilitating the access of researchers and other healthcare professionals to individual-level data.
METHODS: Commands are sent from a central analysis computer (AC) to several data computers (DCs) storing the data to be co-analysed. The data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel. The separate parallelized analyses are linked by non-disclosive summary statistics and commands transmitted back and forth between the DCs and the AC. This paper describes the technical implementation of DataSHIELD using a modified R statistical environment linked to an Opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each DC. Analysis is controlled through a standard R environment at the AC.
RESULTS: Based on this Opal/R implementation, DataSHIELD is currently used by the Healthy Obese Project and the Environmental Core Project (BioSHaRE-EU) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight European countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the DataSHIELD approach.
CONCLUSIONS: DataSHIELD facilitates important research in settings where: (i) a co-analysis of individual-level data from several studies is scientifically necessary but governance restrictions prohibit the release or sharing of some of the required data, and/or render data access unacceptably slow; (ii) a research group (e.g. in a developing nation) is particularly vulnerable to loss of intellectual property-the researchers want to fully share the information held in their data with national and international collaborators, but do not wish to hand over the physical data themselves; and (iii) a data set is to be included in an individual-level co-analysis but the physical size of the data precludes direct transfer to a new site for analysis.},
